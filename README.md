# 💡 Digilab Landing Page Clone

This project is a clone of a modern and minimalistic **landing page design**, recreated using **HTML** and **CSS** to demonstrate and improve my frontend development skills. The layout was inspired by a clean UI/UX example and enhanced with custom elements, including a navigation bar, responsive design, and sleek animations to give it a more professional and functional look.
